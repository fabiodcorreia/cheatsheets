## Commands

### Open file

Open a new buffer with a file.

`:e <file-nama>`

### Save

Save the buffer to the file. If the buffer doesn't have a fila associated or if
we want to save to a different file and keep changing the current one we can
provide a file name.

`:w` or `:w <file-name>`

### Save as

Save the current buffer in a new file and opens it in a new buffer. The old file
is not deleted.

`:saveas <file-name>`

### Search and replace on the current line

Replace the `para1` with `para2` on the first match.

`:s/para1/para2` Regex can also be used on `para1`.

`:s/para1/para2/g` Replace all the matches on line

### Search and replace on the current file

Replace all the `para1` with `para2` on the first match of every line.

`:%s/para1/para2` Regex can also be used on `para1`.

`:%s/para1/para2/g` Replace all the matches globaly on the buffer.

### Set buffer filetype

Change the filetype of a buffer

`:set filetype=markdown` or `:Telescope file_types`







i = {
-- go to beginning and end
["<C-b>"] = { "<ESC>^i", "Beginning of line" },
["<C-e>"] = { "<End>", "End of line" },

    -- navigate within insert mode
    ["<C-h>"] = { "<Left>", "Move left" },
